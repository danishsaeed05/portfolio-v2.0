## About Me

 I am currently taking Honours in Computer Science at the University of Guelph. I will be graduating in 2021 April. I also am developing a mobile application for a non-profit organization to gain some experience. During my spare time, I solve different programming(algorithms, Data Structures, etc.) problems to expand my knowledge and become a better programmer.
